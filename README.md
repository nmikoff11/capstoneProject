TrackIt Expense Tracker, 

This is an application that allows a user to track their income and expense for a given day. It is a user friendly program that is 
highly customizable that allows users to add and update categories that they see fit to add to their profile. It allows users to add
quick add categories, user paychecks, new categories, entries(income or expense). 

This then calculates a daytotal, expenses vs incomes and lets the user see how much they have spent for a single day. It allows users
to see how which categories they have entered for each entry, and allows users to search specific dates to analyze totals for those specific dates. 

Updates to come are more personalization of categories to add in frequency of a category to make it less user work to enter entries in. i.e if the user has a monthly car payment that would be a category specification that then always makes the entry a monthly entry, without 
the user directly specifying further after creating the category. 

This project utilized 
Java, NetBeans, Thymeleaf, JUnit, Maven, Spring MVC, XML, Spring Boot, JPA, MySql, JavaScript Bootstrap, HTML5 , CSS.
